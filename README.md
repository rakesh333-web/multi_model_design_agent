# Multi-Agent UI/UX Analysis

This project implements a multi-agent design team that analyzes the UI/UX of mobile and web apps. The system includes three distinct agents:

- **Visual Agent**: Evaluates the visual design and aesthetics of the app.
- **UX Agent**: Analyzes the user experience and interaction flow.
- **Market Agent**: Assesses the app's market positioning and user reception.

Results from the analysis are compiled and presented in a comprehensive [Demo](multi_agent_result.pdf).
